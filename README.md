# Abstract Clock – Light Windows

This project aims to visualize time using a grid of illuminated “windows.”

- **Hour** is represented by a brighter horizontal band within the grid.
- **Minute** is represented by the total number of lit windows, filling the facade over time.
- **Second** is represented by a moving bright window and subtle shimmer animation.
